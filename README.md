7.end:
A closing remark or additional comment related to the animal, often written in a friendly tone.

~Purpose:
The dataset is a collection of information about various sea animals, covering their common names, scientific classifications, habitats, physical characteristics, behaviors, and fun facts. It provides a concise summary of each animal's unique features and offers interesting trivia to engage readers

~resources:
I gathered the dataset by extracting information from a chat system, focusing on creating a structured collection of detailed facts about various sea animals. This dataset will be integrated into a web-based user interface

~code overview:
 
The accompanying code is a Python program designed to preprocess and interact with the dataset. It standardizes the names of animals in the dataset for easier searching, allowing users to query information about a specific animal by its name. The search functionality retrieves comprehensive details about the animal, including its type, scientific name, habitat, and fun facts, or notifies the user if no match is found,This combination of dataset and code offers a user-friendly way to explore educational and engaging details about sea animals.

~Data Retrieval Using the Code:
The predicted name is passed to the search_animal function.
The function searches the dataset for the matching name.
If a match is found, it retrieves and formats the animal's information.

~Result Display:
The application displays detailed information about the predicted animal, 
including:
Its category (type)
Scientific name
Habitat
Physical characteristics
Behavior
Fun facts
A friendly closing remark

Benefits of the Code:
1.Scalability: Can be applied to larger datasets with similar structures.
2.Case-Insensitive Search: Ensures user input does not need to be exact (e.g., "whale" vs "Whale").
3.User-Friendly Output: Returns information in a clear, structured format.
This combination of dataset and code offers a user-friendly way to explore educational and engaging details about sea animals.
